## **News:**
The website of NeuRec Workshop 2020 has been set up. 


## **About the NeuRec Workshop 2020** 
The Workshop on Advanced Neural Algorithms and Theories for Recommender Systems (NeuRec) will be co-located with ICDM 2020 to held on November 17-20, 2020, Sorrento, Italy. This workshop provides a more focused, in-depth venue for presentations, discussions and interactions on the area of data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence and recommender systems. The workshop will solicit papers (max 8 pages plus 2 extra pages) for peer review. Furthermore, as in previous years, papers that are not accepted by the main conference will be automatically sent to a workshop selected by the authors when the papers were submitted to the main conference. By the unique ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.


## **Call for Papers**
### A brief introduction
Nowadays, the renaissance of artificial intelligence (AI) hasattracted huge attention from every corner of the world.  Onthe one hand,  neural algorithms and theories (include shal-low and deep ones) have nearly dominated AI developmentin almost all areas, e.g., natural language processing (NLP),computer  vision  (CV)  and  planning  and  have  shown  greatpromise.  On the other hand, recommender systems (RS), asone of the most popular and important applications of AI, hasbeen widely planted into our daily life and has made a hugedifference.  Naturally, the combination of neural algorithmsand theories and recommender systems has been flourishingfor  years  and  has  shown  great  potential.   In  practice,  neu-ral models and algorithms have nearly dominated the recom-mender system research in recent years.  Many state-of-the-art recommender systems are built on neural algorithms, es-pecially deep neural algorithms.  However, most of existingresearchers often only focus on the application of deep neuralmodels to solve the problems in recommender systems, theyeither  ignore  the  more  efficient  shallow  and  light  weightedneural models or overlook the fundamental theories behindthese neural models,  and the intrinsic connections betweenthese theories and the recommender system issues.

This  workshop  aims  to  systematically  discuss  the  recentadvancements  of  both  shallow  and  deep  neural  algorithmsfor  recommender  systems  from  both  the  application  andtheoretical  perspectives.Particularly,  the  recent  progressachieved in both shallow and deep neural recommender sys-tem algorithms together with the related theories will be dis-cussed. Furthermore, both the recent progress achieved in theacademia and the industry will be covered.

This workshop solicits the latest and significant contribu-tions on developing and applying neural algorithms and the-ories for building intelligent recommender systems.
